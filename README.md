# Stock-History

This Python program offers a straightforward tool for stock traders to analyze potential bullish signals through the crossing of moving averages. Utilizing the Yahoo Finance API, the program allows users to select two moving day averages, and scans to see if the shorter period moving average has recently crossed the longer period one. These crosses may indicate shifts in momentum, or a bullish trajectory.
